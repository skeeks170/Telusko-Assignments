Purpose:

Annotations: Annotations provide metadata about program elements (classes, methods, fields, etc.) that can be used by tools, frameworks, and libraries to perform specific actions or configurations. They are primarily used for declarative programming, configuration, and runtime processing.
Interfaces: Interfaces define a contract that a class can implement. They specify a set of method signatures that must be implemented by the classes that implement the interface. Interfaces are used for achieving abstraction, defining common behavior, and facilitating polymorphism.

Usage:

Annotations: Annotations are applied to program elements using the @ symbol, such as @AnnotationName. They can be used to provide instructions, mark elements for special treatment, or provide additional information about the elements.
Interfaces: Interfaces are implemented by classes using the implements keyword. A class can implement multiple interfaces to inherit and define the behavior specified by those interfaces.

Code Structure:

Annotations: Annotations do not define any behavior or functionality on their own. They are primarily used for metadata purposes and are not executable code.
Interfaces: Interfaces define method signatures that participating classes must implement. They can also include constants and default method implementations (since Java 8).

Inheritance and Polymorphism:

Annotations: Annotations do not support inheritance or polymorphism. Each annotation is independent and cannot inherit or extend other annotations.
Interfaces: Interfaces support inheritance and polymorphism. A class can implement multiple interfaces, and interfaces can extend other interfaces, forming an inheritance hierarchy.

Runtime Reflection:

Annotations: Annotations can be accessed and processed at runtime using reflection. They provide metadata that can be queried and utilized during runtime.
Interfaces: Interfaces do not provide explicit metadata or reflection capabilities. They define the contract for behavior but do not contain specific metadata about classes implementing them.
